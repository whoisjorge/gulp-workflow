## Overview

This tool is focused to developers who are currently loading in resources in their code via multiple style/script tags and finding that dependency management, or even mantainment of the project architecture, is becoming "a little" cumbersome as their webpages or applications start to grow.

A modern starter kit with which you are going to build your very own workflows, as advanced as your needs require, and become a PROUDltimate Front-end Developer. No more boilerplates or annoying manual bullshit tasks, damn!
